# Employees_vacation_system
My first program in Python. The aim of this program is to calculate how many vacations days the employees have based on the following parameters:

-How many years the employee has been working for the company

-The department of the employee belongs to, could be logistics, direction, client attention. Due to each of one of the departments has a different vacation policy.
